# Smartphone-Specifications-Price-Classification
# Project Overview
The "Smartphones Specification and Price Classification" project aims to explore and analyze the relationship between various smartphone specifications and their corresponding prices. Through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project identifies key factors influencing smartphone pricing, uncovers trends and patterns in the data, and provides insights into how different specifications correlate with the cost of smartphones. This analysis can help consumers make informed purchasing decisions and manufacturers understand market dynamics better.
